##new-light Light Table | Skin
Light background skin based on the inverted new-dark skin.

###Motivation

- I prefer light background over dark background, simply because most of the applications use light background and swithching between them and LightTable hurts my eyes
- needed something which goes well with the new iplastic theme

##Known issues

- the colors are not really "light", but much better than the default (and only) dark skin
- some colors which are green originally now redish, might be misleading
- the font is black and the text selection color is dark, so it is not the best (see screenshot 1 on the right)
